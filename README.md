Build your own QGIS plugin
##########################

Get help in transforming your code to a QGIS plugin, but also:

- Write test classes for your code;
- Create online documentation (like what you are reading now);
- What are the requirements to upload your plugin to the official QGIS repository;
- Build and upload a python package to PyPi.

The **instruction pages** can be found at <https://create-qgis-plugin.readthedocs.io>.
