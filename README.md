# Shipwreck Finder QGIS Plugin

![QGIS_Main](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/946e6332-d93b-4585-94af-745456292167)

This [QGIS](https://www.qgis.org/en/site/) plugin identifies potential shipwreck sites from multibeam sonar data. Raster layers are passed through a deep learning segmentation model to produce a binary segmentation mask that clearly identifies the shipwreck site, and bounding boxes can be extracted from these segmentation masks if desired. Four different models are available for use, each trained with a unique backbone, and each with their own strengths and weaknesses.

This repo accompanies the paper "ShipwreckFinder: A QGIS Tool for Shipwreck Detection in Multibeam Sonar Data" presented at OCEANS 2025 Great Lakes. Link to paper: [http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21386](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21386).
